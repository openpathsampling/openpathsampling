Our thanks to the `E-CAM Horizon 2020 Project <https://www.e-cam2020.eu>`_,
which provided both the workshops where several of these presentations were
made, as well as the technical expertise in filming the videos.

*E-CAM ESDW: Topics in Classical MD; Lyon, France (2019)*

This video mostly focuses on general concepts related to path sampling and
trajectory based rare events.  That workshop included a "hackathon" software
development period, and the video includes suggestions for several such
projects (many of which have since been added to OPS).

*E-CAM ESDW; Leiden, The Netherlands (2017)*

This video comes from a "hackathon"-style workshop, and discusses various
parts of OPS that would be of interest to new contributors to the code.
