Multiple State TIS on a Toy Model
==================================

This example covers the use the multiple state TIS on a simple toy model.
We recommend new users start by working through these notebooks because (1)
these notebooks have the most details discussion, and (2) the systems are
simple enough that the simulations can be run interactively.

This example consists of three notebooks: one to obtain initial
trajectories, one to perform the TIS simulation, and one to do the analysis
after.

For more advanced techniques based on the same system, see the subsequent
notebooks in the `directory containing these examples
<https://github.com/openpathsampling/openpathsampling/tree/master/examples/toy_model_mstis>`_.
