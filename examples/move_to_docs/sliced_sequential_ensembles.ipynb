    "# Combining `SequentialEnsembles` with `SlicedTrajectoryEnsembles`\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble creation features in OpenPathSampling are very powerful, but the ways that some of them interact with each other can be quite confusing. In this document, we explore what happens when one combines `SequentialEnsembles` and `SlicedTrajectoryEnsembles`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's summarize what each of these ensembles do. `SequentialEnsemble`s take a list of ensembles and applies them in order, so a trajectory satisfies the first ensemble for as long as it can, then it switches to the next ensemble, and so forth. `SlicedTrajectoryEnsemble`s modify the trajectory seen by a given ensemble by applying a Python `slice` object to select only certain frames from the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways of slicing `SequentialEnsemble`s; the purpose of this document is to explain the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To make discussion easy, we'll use a fake order parameter and fake trajectories in this example. We'll also define all our ensembles in terms of `AllInXEnsemble`s and `AllOutXEnsemble`s, which are easier to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with `SequentialEnsemble`s, we should distinguish between two types of trajectories. There's the total trajectory for the ensemble, which the normal trajectory including all frames. However, each subensemble of the `SequentialEnsemble` applies to a subtrajectory. The key to the subtleties of how `SequentialEnsemble`s interact with `SlicedTrajectoryEnsemble`s is to consider the which of these trajectories we really want to slice."

For example, we might want to have an ensemble that begins in a state, and after the first exit all even frames (counted from the start of the trajectory) are outside the state. This differs from the previous example because the count is based on the total trajectory, not the subtrajectory which is passed to the ensemble. To do this, we need to use a `SlicedSequentialEnsemble`, a subclass of `SequentialEnsemble` which requires initializing with a list containing one slice for each member ensemble (the special case `None` is turned into `slice(None,None)`)."

So `SlicedTrajectoryEnsemble(ensemble, even_slice) | SlicedTrajectoryEnsemble(ensemble, odd_slice)` is not the same as `ensemble`: the combination of `SlicedTrajectoryEnsemble`s looks at each of the subtrajectories, not at the total trajectory you would expect if you `or`'d together the two slices."
